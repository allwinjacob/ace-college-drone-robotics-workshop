By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:

### 🤖 Robotics Track
- Understand the basics of microcontrollers (Arduino) and embedded systems.
- Build and program circuits using sensors, actuators, and motor drivers.
- Use Python and OpenCV for real-time robotics applications.
- Design mechanical components in Fusion 360.
- Work with Linux systems and terminal tools.
- Understand the fundamentals of AI, Machine Learning, and NLP.
- Build and deploy chatbots using Python.
- Run large language models (LLMs) locally and through APIs.
- Integrate OpenAI and Google GenAI for custom AI applications.

### 🚁 Drone Track
- Choose the right drone components (battery, motors, ESC, FC) based on use-case.
- Understand BLDC motors and KV ratings.
- Assemble and wire a complete drone from scratch.
- Configure flight controllers (e.g., using Betaflight).

### 🤖🚁 Final Projects

#### ✅ Humanoid Robot
Participants will build a **functioning humanoid robot** capable of basic movement and conversation. This robot will:
- Communicate using voice/text (chatbot integration)
- Demonstrate basic interactions (head/arm movement, responses)
- Use AI/ML models to understand and respond to queries

#### ✅ Drone with Real-World Use Case
Participants will also build a **custom drone** designed for a specific application, such as:
- Surveillance & live video streaming
- Object detection using onboard camera
- Search and rescue simulation
- Precision delivery demo

These projects bring together everything learned during the workshop — from hardware assembly to AI integration.
